# Autonomus-Tagging-of-Stackoverflow-Questions

We present a system that is able to automatically assign tags to the questions from question-answering site StackOverflow.

We propose a multi-label classification system that automatically tags users’ questions to enhance user experience.  

We implement a one-vs-rest classifier for a Stack Overflow dataset, using a linear SVM and a carefully chosen subset of the
entire feature set explored
